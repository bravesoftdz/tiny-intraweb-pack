FM SOFT IW Tiny Component pack version 1.0.1


This tiny pack contains two IW components: TIWFMTabControl and TIWFMComboBox.

Compile and install the package and run Demo.dpr

TIWFMTabControl is a descendant of TIWTabControl with better looking tabs.

TIWFMComboBox is an editable ComboBox

Components are tested on Delphi versions 2007, 2009 and 2010.

IW verions prior to 9.0.42 are not tested.

Known problems:
TIWFMTabControl IDE designers don't work as intended. It must be a problem with IW default designer which doesn't work correctly with TIWTabControl descendants.
